DOCUMENTATION:

This exploit sends hundreds of random doctored usernames at the server which causes the FTP server to overload until it uses up to 98% CPU usage until it crashes.

USAGE:
to use the exploit you just need to modify the contents of the IP and the port (optional the port) and finally just execute it. As soon as the program finishes running and the FTP server is not down yet, rerun it from different terminals as it is not based on IP address but on the characters sent against the server.
